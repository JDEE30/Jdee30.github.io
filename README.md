A website explaining the struggles of homelessness in america.

This website uses materialize css for the framework to keep the websites front end development quick and easy.

I used twitter feeds for responsive and interactive seo efforts.

I used the google map's api so that people can search for homeless shelters and donation centers near them.

The main idea of this website is to provide a more modern look to helping the homeless.
The end goal is to create something where modern technology makes helping others more convenient as I beleive
by modernizing the way we give back we are able to actually help that much more by leveraging modern technology.

After looking at similiar websites, I realized that this particular cause or niche could really benefit from using api's and 
integrating other technology to allow this cause to get more eyes on it.

Currently, I am using google map's api to allow users to search for things that could help out the homeless.
Later I plan to add more features. For istance, I want to implement a payment processing system to take donations and automatically 
find users to deliver those donations to people in need via an incentive derived from the donation.

This technology would be akin to how uber eats leverages google maps and some logistics to dispatch people to a users location.
